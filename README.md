## 📖 Overview

The **Restaurant Operations Dashboard** is a sophisticated multi-tenant SaaS application designed to empower restaurant groups with data-driven insights. It bridges the gap between daily operations and high-level financial oversight, providing a unified platform for employees, managers, and executives.

Built with a focus on **scalability, security, and performance**, this dashboard showcases modern frontend architecture using React 19 and Vite, integrated with a robust role-based access control (RBAC) system.

> **Note:**
> This is a high-fidelity demonstration project. While the frontend and business logic are fully implemented, data persistence is handled via a service layer that can be connected to any compatible REST API.
